# Call of Duty Server Monitor (CSM)

A lightweight Windows application that displays Call of Duty server connection details in real-time. This tool helps players make informed decisions about their server connections, especially useful in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 where server latency information isn't visible in the lobby.

## Important Notes

- This application requires administrator privileges to monitor network events
- This application only monitors Call of Duty network traffic and doesn't modify any game files
- The information displayed in this app can also be found in: <br>
`Task Manager > Resource Monitor > Network tab`,
but this app presents it in a more convenient and game-specific format

## Troubleshooting

- If no server information is displayed:
  - Verify that the correct network interface is selected in the dropdown menu
  - Ensure the game is running and you are in a lobby or match
  - Check if you have administrator privileges
  - Verify that Npcap is properly installed

## Privacy

This application only monitors the network traffic between your device and Call of Duty servers. It works completely offline - it doesn't connect to any external servers, doesn't collect any personal data, and doesn't send anything over the internet. Everything happens locally on your PC.
